# ModernBlog Platform - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create a fully functional blogging platform with essential WordPress-like features
- Implement modern Laravel + Vue.js architecture with API-first design 
- Build responsive, user-friendly interfaces for both admin dashboard and public blog
- Demonstrate clean separation between backend API and frontend applications
- Develop practical skills in full-stack development using modern frameworks

### Background Context

Traditional content management systems like WordPress, while powerful, often come with architectural limitations that make modern development practices challenging. This project addresses the need for a clean, API-first blogging platform that leverages Laravel's robust backend capabilities and Vue.js's reactive frontend framework.

The ModernBlog Platform will serve as both a functional blogging system and a learning exercise in modern full-stack development, focusing on API-first architecture, clean code principles, and modern user experience design.

- **Version Control**: Git with feature branch workflow
- **IDE**: VS Code or PhpStorm with appropriate extensions

### Third-Party Dependencies
- **Laravel Sanctum**: API token authentication
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API communication
- **Vue Router**: Client-side routing for SPA dashboard
- **Bootstrap or Tailwind**: CSS framework for rapid UI development

### Deployment Assumptions
